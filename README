This is a project done for the Software Engineering course in my 2nd Year of
B.Tech CSE at IIT Kharagpur along with a teammate(Srinath Mandava).
It is a CASE(Computer Aided Software Engineering) Tool used to create data flow diagrams, hierarchies etc.
The Structured Analysis part isn't fully implemented.So beware. It uses serialization to save files.
User Manual will be suppliedrequest(thisisma08@gmail.com).
It was just done for a project, no correctness and support is guaranteed.

Done by Sourya Kakarla and Srinath Mandava
